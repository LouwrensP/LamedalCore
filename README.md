# Roadmap
* Create a simple but functional .NET Core library. (Done)
* Create test cases with at least 95% code coverage of the library. (Done) 
* Create a simple c# code parser to evaluate code on a macro scale. (In progress)
* Create Visual Studio Tools to support the Lamedal framework. (Future)
* Use Lamedal tools to refactor and optimise source code. (Future)
* Publish Lamedal Blueprint rule framework methodology. (Future)
* Demo's to illustrate how Blueprint tools is used to create Lamedal extensions. (Future)

# Setup
Please note that the library is still in its starting phases. Radical design changes will occur between versions.
